Composed

```go
package cmds

import (
	Z "github.com/rwxrob/bonzai"
	"github.com/rwxrob/y2j"
)

var Cmd = &Z.Cmd{
	Name:     `cmds`,

}
```

## Embedded Documentation

All documentation (like manual pages) has been embedded into the source
code of the application. See the source or run the program with help to
access it.

## Design Considerations

* **Nothing but maps.**

  It is extremely rare to encounter a YAML array in the wild. It is
  common, however, to have a map with a single array as it's value.
